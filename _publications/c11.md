Facial expression recognition (FER) serves as a vi-
tal interface for bridging human emotions and ma-
chine understanding, enabling applications across psy-
chology, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.
This study explores the performance of machine learn-
ing classifiers—SVM, Random Forest, KNN, and Deci-
sion Tree—on the CK+ dataset, a benchmark for FER
research. Preprocessing techniques, such as grayscale
conversion and histogram equalization, were employed
to enhance feature clarity. Features extracted via His-
togram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) were evaluated us-
ing k-fold cross-validation. SVM emerged as the most ac-
curate classifier, achieving a 100% recognition rate with
a linear kernel, while Random Forest demonstrated ro-
bust but slightly inferior performance. Decision Tree and
KNN exhibited lower accuracies, highlighting the trade-
offs between interpretability and performance. These
findings underline the potential of SVM for designing
reliable and eﬀicient FER systems suitable for practical
applications.
