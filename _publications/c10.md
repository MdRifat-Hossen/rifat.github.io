This research explores the application of deep learning
techniques for emotion recognition using bone-conducted
(BC) speech, utilizing the EmoBone dataset—the first
dataset specifically created for this purpose. The study
aims to investigate the effectiveness of deep learning ap-
proaches in recognizing emotions from BC speech while
addressing challenges such as degradation and informa-
tion loss in neural networks. By implementing advanced
models, the research compares the accuracy of emotion
recognition with other relevant techniques, showcasing
the advantages of BC speech in terms of noise resilience
and privacy. The findings contribute to the develop-
ment of more accurate and reliable emotion recognition
systems, creating the way for innovative applications in
fields such as healthcare, human-computer interaction,
and secure communication systems.
