Speech emotion recognition (SER) is a critical tech-
nology that supports advances in human-computer interaction,
mental health assessment, and personalized education. Despite
significant progress, conventional SER methods relying on air-
conducted (AC) speech remain vulnerable to environmental
noise and recording inconsistencies, which impede robust real-
world deployment. A promising alternative, bone-conducted (BC)
speech, captures internal vocal tract vibrations and demonstrates
inherent resilience to ambient noise. However, the scarcity of
authentic BC datasets and the prohibitive cost of BC sensors
severely constrain its practical utilization in SER research.
Furthermore, existing efforts have yet to establish scalable
approaches to harness BC speech characteristics without spe-
cialized acquisition hardware, limiting the generalizability of
current models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that synthesizes BC-like speech from standard AC
recordings via a carefully designed Infinite Impulse Response
(IIR) filter. This method enables cost-effective, large-scale aug-
mentation of training data, circumventing the need for specialized
BC sensors. The core of our approach is an attention-augmented
convolutional neural network that effectively integrates local
spectral feature extraction with long-range temporal model-
ing. To counteract class imbalance and improve generalization,
the model employs class-weighted loss combined with label
smoothing. Evaluated on the benchmark RAVDESS dataset, our
framework achieves state-of-the-art results: a validation accuracy
of 95.51%, balanced accuracy of 95.32%, Matthews Correlation
Coefficient of 0.9487, and flawless class-wise AUC scores. A high
mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.9163 further confirms
the model’s precision and robustness across diverse emotional
categories.
