The garment industry significantly boosts Bangladesh’s economy, contributing
over 80% to export earnings and employing millions of people. Effective pro-
duction planning is vital for operational efficiency; however, establishing productivity
targets often depends on manual judgment, resulting in unrealistic expectations. This
study introduces a data-driven framework utilizing machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) methods to accurately predict productivity targets, supplemented by
Explainable AI (XAI) tools such as SHAP and LIME. Various models—including Lin-
ear Regression, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost, Neural Network (NN), Deep Neural
Network (DNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)—were assessed through
10-fold cross-validation. Performance metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2) identified the
Neural Network as the top performer, achieving an R2of 0.987. The incorporation
of XAI facilitated understanding of feature influences, emphasizing factors like SMV,
WIP, idle time, and overtime. This methodology promotes transparent and intelligent
planning, enabling factory managers to make better-informed, data-driven decisions.
