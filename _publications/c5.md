The precise identification of brain tumors via MRI
imaging continues to pose a considerable challenge within the
domain of medical diagnostics. Although conventional deep
learning models have shown effectiveness, they often encounter
difficulties in detecting accuracy and efficiency in various types of
tumors. In this research, we introduce an enhanced approach for
brain tumor detection that employs the latest YOLOv12 object
detection framework. We assess and contrast the performance of
YOLOv12 with several other leading models, illustrating its supe-
rior detection accuracy. The YOLOv12n model notably achieves
the highest mAP@50 of 93.3%, outperforming previous YOLO
versions and conventional techniques. The model is trained and
evaluated using a comprehensive MRI dataset that includes
various tumour types, thereby ensuring its generalisability and
robustness. These findings highlight YOLOv12’s potential as a
reliable, quick, and accurate method for real-time brain tumor
diagnosis and medical picture analysis.
